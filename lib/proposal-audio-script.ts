 * this is a money document, so the audio must read the exact same
 * numbers `packageTotal` puts on the page. Pure module (no server-only,
 * no DB) so it's unit-testable and hashable anywhere.
 *
 * The hash of the script is the audio cache key: /api/p/[token]/audio
 * regenerates the MP3 only when the script text changes (price edit,
 * negotiated discount, package rename), otherwise serves the cached
 * blob. Keep the output stable — cosmetic rewording invalidates every
