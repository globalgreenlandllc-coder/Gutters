/**
 * roof-engine.ts — deterministic roof geometry engine for the gutter takeoff.
 *
 * This is the TypeScript port of the spec's `roof_engine.py`. It draws the roof
 * BY RULE, not by eye: the vision model reads sheets and returns outlines +
 * gables (span / pitch / projection); this engine reconciles them into
 * classified edges, generates each gable's ridge-back and paired valleys,
 * runs the gates (closure, reentrant-corner, gable-anchor, area, long-run), and
 * computes the eave-LF + downspout takeoff. It NEVER guesses — anything it can't
 * resolve becomes a structured `ReviewFlag` instead of an invented number.
 *
 * TWO LAWS it enforces (see the spec):
 *  - LAW 1 — the model reads; the code reconciles. Geometry (closure, offsets,
 *    valley placement, area checks, downspout math) lives HERE, not in a prompt.
 *  - LAW 2 — a projection's side edges are guttered eaves whose length equals
 *    its depth; width comes from the facing view, depth from the perpendicular
 *    view. `buildGableByRule` is the concrete expression of this law.
 *
 * DESIGN RULES (mirror roof-skeleton.ts / reconcile-eaves.ts):
 *  - PURE + directive-free (no "server-only", no DOM, no React) so it runs in
 *    the browser bundle AND under `node`/`tsx --test`.
 *  - Deterministic: same input → same output. No Date.now()/Math.random().
 *  - Never throws on the happy path; malformed input yields flags, not crashes.
 *  - Coordinate-space agnostic: operates in whatever units it's handed (feet for
 *    a scaled takeoff, or raw PDF pixels). The +y direction is a caller choice;
 *    `facing` vectors are relative, so the engine is correct in either.
