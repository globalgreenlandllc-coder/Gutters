/**
 * Estimate → Proposal handoff via localStorage.
 *
 * The proposal flow lives at /proposal and was originally always seeded
 * with sampleMeasurements regardless of what the contractor actually
 * estimated. This module gives the estimate flow a way to hand its live
 * takeoff data to the proposal flow without threading a server-side
 * draft-proposal record through the router (which is the right long-term
 * answer but a bigger change). The localStorage payload is consumed
 * once on /proposal mount and cleared immediately so a manual refresh
 * doesn't re-apply stale data.
 *
 * Payload includes the full takeoff (eaves + rakes + downspouts + the
 * satellite image data URL) so the proposal can render the *actual*
 * traced roof instead of a cartoon, and so the contractor can keep
 * editing eaves/downspouts from inside the proposal view.
